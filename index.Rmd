subtitle: How Environmental Factors Affect Range

# Introduction
Species ranges are restricted based on the ecological features they are suited to inhabit. This constraint can cause a speciesâ€™ range to exist as highly fragmented populations or be relatively ubiquitous over a large area based on the location of these features. Bison populations are subject to this range restriction, preferring habitats with a large amount of open area, drier climates and mid-range elevations where grasses grow well [@Lott2017]. Due to these assumptions it is expected that bison would be found in areas that meet all or most of these standards. In order to examine how habitats are able to affect bison populations and their locations, species observations can be used to determine which habitat types are most suitable for bison and where they are located[@Palma99]. From this analysis a map of locations that are suitable for bison will be created based on a selected model. From this map it is expected that highly suitable points will be found within Yellowstone National Park, as it is the only location within the United States with a wild bison herd[@IUCN]. Additionally, it is expected that locations with mid- to high-elevations, mid-range climates and low forest cover will be most suitable for the species.

# Materials and methods


1. Install and load required packages:
```{r,message=F, warning=F}
install.packages('wallace')
install.packages('spocc')
install.packages('spThin')
install.packages('dismo')
install.packages('rgeos')
install.packages('ENMeval')
library(spocc)
library(spThin)
library(dismo)
library(rgeos)
library(ENMeval)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(wallace)
```

The wallace package also requires integration that is not included with the package. The funcition system.file will find them and source will load it:

```{r,message=F, warning=F}
source(system.file('shiny/funcs', 'functions.R', package='wallace'))
```

2. Obtating Occurence Data

Occurance data will be downloaded from the gbif database [@gbif2018]. This data was limited to 3000 records and therefore could not contain all occurence data points.

```{r,message=F, warning=F}
results <- spocc::occ(query = "Bison bison", from = "gbif", limit = 3000, has_coords = TRUE)
results.data <- results[["gbif"]]$data[[formatSpName("Bison bison")]]
occs <- remDups(results.data)
```

Rows where coordinates are duplicates must be removed. Latitudes and longitudes must also be checked to be sure they are numeric.

```{r,message=F, warning=F}
occs$latitude <- as.numeric(occs$latitude)
occs$longitude <- as.numeric(occs$longitude)
```

Collected records can all be labeled with unique names.

```{r,message=F, warning=F}
occs$origID <- row.names(occs)
```

The data then needed to be filtered to only include observations located within the Continental United States.This was done by selecting observations that fell witin the shapefile of the United States given within the Wallace program. Although 2889 observations were created, this number was reduce to reduce error and increase speed. After this sorting was done 700 total occurance points were included in the analysis.


```{r,message=F, warning=F}
occs=occs[c(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 117, 119, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 332, 333, 334, 335, 337, 338, 339, 341, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 371, 373, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 386, 387, 388, 390, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 407, 408, 410, 411, 412, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 513, 514, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 536, 538, 539, 540, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698, 699, 700, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709) ,] 
```

This data can be plotted over the United States file that can be found using the getData function along with ggplot.

```{r,message=F, warning=F}
us=getData('GADM',country='USA',level=1)
```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map of Observation Data Within the United Sates"}

ggplot(occs,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+ geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=us)+ geom_point(col="red")+coord_equal()
```



Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")

ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
```


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

Figure 1:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map of Observation Data Within the United Sates"}

ggplot(occs,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+ geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=us)+ geom_point(col="red")+coord_equal()
```

This map shows the raw occurence data that was found to be within the United States limits.This map only includes 700 data points from a total of near 3000 possible in order to excellerate processing time.It can be seen that while bison observations are widespread across the United States, there is a preference of the species towards the western portion of the country.
