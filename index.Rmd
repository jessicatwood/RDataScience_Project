# Introduction
Species ranges are restricted based on the ecological features they are suited to inhabit. This constraint can cause a speciesâ€™ range to exist as highly fragmented populations or be relatively ubiquitous over a large area based on the location of these features. Bison populations are subject to this range restriction, preferring habitats with a large amount of open area, drier climates and mid-range elevations. Due to these assumptions it is expected that bison would be found in areas that meet all or most of these standards. In order to examine how habitats are able to affect bison populations and their locations, species observations can be used to determine which habitat types are most suitable for bison and where they are located.

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")

ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
```


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r}
summary(d)
```

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
